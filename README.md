Improved based on the comments from presentation, including making color of disaster consistent for each state and describing more logically.

Team members: Zan Li, Jianjie Sun

Summary: In this project, we leverage the Dash framework to build a web application designed for comprehensive analysis of disaster incidents across U.S. states. The application not only examines the frequency and types of disasters occurring in each state but also correlates them with the corresponding federal emergency funding that has been granted. This enables stakeholders to gain insights into the effectiveness of resource allocation and to identify areas in need of additional support. The application incorporates advanced geospatial visualization techniques to provide a more intuitive understanding of the allocation of federal funding and the types of disasters occurring across U.S. states. Utilizing a color-coded map, the intensity of the color signifies either the magnitude of granted federal funding or the frequency of disaster incidents. Users can interactively click on individual states to access detailed data and insights. This Dash-powered platform offers a nuanced and comprehensive view of the disaster landscape and associated federal financial support across different regions of the United States. The datasets we used are Disaster Declarations Summaries and Emergency Management Performance Grants which can be found on https://www.fema.gov/about/openfema/data-sets.

[Contribution Statement] In Group 3, which consists solely of Zan Li and Jianjie Sun, both members actively participated in every aspect of the project. Our collaborative efforts encompassed the initial conceptualization and design of the study, the development of a baseline classification model for subsequent evaluations, and an exploration into feature engineering techniques aimed at enhancing the model's performance. Furthermore, we crafted a rigorous model evaluation protocol, executed the computational tasks required for this evaluation, and meticulously curated our GitHub repository. We also took on the responsibility of preparing the final presentation that synthesizes our work. Both team members have reviewed and fully endorse the content and findings presented in our GitHub repository, including this contribution statement.
