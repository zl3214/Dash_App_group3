### A Note on Contributions

Whenever we have team projects, there are always concerns on unequal contributions from members of a project team. In the ideal world, we are all here to put in our best efforts and learn together. Even in that ideal world, we have different skill sets and preparations, and we will still contribute differently to a project. 

Therefore, you are required to post a *contribution statement* in the root README.md of your GitHub repo. Please beware that your GitHub repo will become public and remain public after the due date of the projects. 

Post your title, team members, project abstract and a contribution statement in the README.md file.  This is a common practice for research scientific journals. 

Below is an example. If no contribution statement is provided, we will insert a default statement that goes "**All team members contributed equally in all stages of this project. All team members approve our work presented in this GitHub repository including this contributions statement**. "

Summary: In this project, we leverage the Dash framework to build a web application designed for comprehensive analysis of disaster incidents across U.S. states. The application not only examines the frequency and types of disasters occurring in each state but also correlates them with the corresponding federal emergency funding that has been granted. This enables stakeholders to gain insights into the effectiveness of resource allocation and to identify areas in need of additional support. The application incorporates advanced geospatial visualization techniques to provide a more intuitive understanding of the allocation of federal funding and the types of disasters occurring across U.S. states. Utilizing a color-coded map, the intensity of the color signifies either the magnitude of granted federal funding or the frequency of disaster incidents. Users can interactively click on individual states to access detailed data and insights. This Dash-powered platform offers a nuanced and comprehensive view of the disaster landscape and associated federal financial support across different regions of the United States. The datasets we used are Disaster Declarations Summaries and Emergency Management Performance Grants which can be found on https://www.fema.gov/about/openfema/data-sets.

[Contribution Statement] In Group 3, which consists solely of Zan Li and Jianjie Sun, both members actively participated in every aspect of the project. Our collaborative efforts encompassed the initial conceptualization and design of the study, the development of a baseline classification model for subsequent evaluations, and an exploration into feature engineering techniques aimed at enhancing the model's performance. Furthermore, we crafted a rigorous model evaluation protocol, executed the computational tasks required for this evaluation, and meticulously curated our GitHub repository. We also took on the responsibility of preparing the final presentation that synthesizes our work. Both team members have reviewed and fully endorse the content and findings presented in our GitHub repository, including this contribution statement.
